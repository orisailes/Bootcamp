// Ex3.1 - Growth Of population
// In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly
// increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the
// town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200
// inhabitants?

// At the end of the first year there will be:
// 1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants
// At the end of the 2nd year there will be:
// 1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (number of inhabitants is an integer)
// At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
// 1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

// More generally given parameters:
// - p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)
